now. **Feedback is welcome.**\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes some formulation of the existing workflow to clarify and facilitate it for current and future authors, and voting members.\r\nIn our discussions, we assessed that a more structured process would help folks who submit the PDEP know how and when it can progress, and how to better engage with others.\r\n\r\nThe timelines were considered to facilitate an engaging discussion, and automation. We aim to make the lives of the PDEP authors easier by taking away the need to decide \"has it been long enough\", or \"cat herding\" folks to engage and clarify their comments so that PDEPs don't get large change requests that could have been clarified early on - late in the process.\r\n\r\nThe quorum was discussed a lot in our working group, and we're unsure about the best strategy here. We were looking for a sufficient number so if a decision is passed one feels it's valid (e.g. maybe 2 people is too low), but not too high so that we feel like ongoing discussions are blocked because it's too hard to get that many voting members involved. Further proposal on this point are welcome.\r\n\r\nWe tried to make things as flexible and clear as possible. Being mindful of the needs of the authors, as well as those engaging in the discussion, be them voting members or not.\r\n\r\nAt this point, we would like to invite feedback. It might be that you need more clarity on the suggestions, have ideas for improvement, or aren't convinced that this will affect the current process positively.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: @MarcoGorelli,
